            <h1 class="me">About the Rat Pack</h1>

            <p class="me">The rat pack started when I was a kid, my friends and I were hanging
              out at a park, and an old lady started to yell at us. We were all
              confused, so we all just ran away. As we ran she called out
              "flee you rats!"
              <br>
              Ever since then I refered to all my friends as rats, and my group
              as the rat pack. I don't know who that lady thought we were, but
              all my friends are a group of weirdos, and misfits. To be part of
              the rat pack means to be yourself, and stick with your rats.

          <h2 class="me">About US</h2>
          <p class="me">This company was started by Isaac, and Ryan life long friends, and
            orignal members of the rack pack. Isaac always knew there was something
            special with the rat pack, so he approached Ryan to start a company.
            At first the following was small, but now we have rats in all 50 states.

        <h1 class="me">Your Journey</h1>

        <p class="me">If you are reading this, you probably want to join the ratpack.
          Just so you know that repping the rat pack is a bigger commitment than
          just wearing some rat themed clothes. It is joining an elite club, you
          have to promise that you will look out for other rats, as other rats
          will have your back. You also commit to living life to the fullest, and
          always be yourself, a rat.
